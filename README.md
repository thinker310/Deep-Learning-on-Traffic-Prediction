Deep Learning on Traffic Prediction
====
1.dataset
----
We collect and summarize available traffic prediction datasets.<br><br>
[Proceed as follows](https://github.com/xueyan-dut/Deep-Learning-on-Traffic-Prediction/blob/main/dataset/download_dataset.md) to download the public datasets used for the prediction task.<br><br><br>
2.experiment
----
We perform a comparative experimental study to evaluate different models, identifying the most effective component.<br><br>
[Proceed as follows](https://github.com/xueyan-dut/Deep-Learning-on-Traffic-Prediction/blob/main/Experiment/config.md) to understand the configuration method of our experiment<br>[Proceed as follows](https://github.com/xueyan-dut/Deep-Learning-on-Traffic-Prediction/blob/main/Experiment/Results/analysis.md) to understand the analysis of our experiment<br><br><br><br>
3.codes
----
We summarize some approaches to deep learning for traffic prediction and presented their public code in [approaches.md](https://github.com/xueyan-dut/Deep-Learning-on-Traffic-Prediction/blob/main/codes/approaches.md)<br><br>Furthermore, we do a taxonomy for existing approaches, describing their key design choices in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08555v4.pdf).<br><br><br>
