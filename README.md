3.codes
----
We summarize some approaches to deep learning for traffic prediction and presented their public code in [approaches.md](https://github.com/xueyan-dut/Deep-Learning-on-Traffic-Prediction/blob/main/codes/approaches.md)<br>For more approches,we do a taxonomy for existing approaches, describing their key design choices in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08555v4.pdf).<br><br>
