Here, we list public, commonly used and large-scale real-world datasets in traffic prediction.<br>
****
## 1 PeMS
### 1.1 source dataset
It is an abbreviation from the California Transportation Agency Performance Measurement System (PeMS), which is displayed on the map and collected in real-time by more than 39000 independent detectors. These sensors span the freeway system across all major metropolitan areas of the State of California. The source is available at: http://pems.dot.ca.gov/.<br><br><br>

## 1.2 sub-dataset versions
Based on this system, several sub-dataset versions (PeMSD3/4/7(M)/7/8/-SF/-BAY) have appeared and are widely used. The main difference is the range of time and space, as well as the number of sensors included in the data collection.<br><br><br>
### 1.3 PeMSD3
This dataset is a piece of data processed by Song et al. It includes 358 sensors and flow information from 9/1/2018 to 11/30/2018. A processed version is available at: https://github.com/Davidham3/STSGCN.<br><br><br>
### 1.4 PeMSD4
It describes the San Francisco Bay Area, and contains 3848 sensors on 29 roads dated from 1/1/2018 until 2/28/2018, 59 days in total. A processed version is available at: https://github.com/Davidham3/ASTGCN/tree/master/data/PEMS04.<br><br><br>
### 1.5 PeMSD7(M)
It describes the District 7 of California containing 228 stations, and The time range of it is in the weekdays of May and June of 2012. A processed version is available at: https://github.com/Davidham3/STGCN/tree/master/datasets. <br><br><br>
### 1.6 PeMSD7
This version was publicly released by Song et al. It contains traffic flow information from 883 sensor stations, covering the period from 7/1/2016 to 8/31/2016. A processed version is available at:https://github.com/Davidham3/STSGCN.<br><br><br>
### 1.7 PeMSD8
It depicts the San Bernardino Area, and contains 1979 sensors on 8 roads dated from 7/1/2016 until 8/31/2016, 62 days in total. A processed version is available at: https://github.com/Davidham3/ASTGCN/tree/master/data/PEMS08.<br><br><br>
### 1.8 PeMSD-SF
This dataset describes the occupancy rate, between 0 and 1, of different car lanes of San Francisco bay area freeways. The time span of these measurements is from 1/1/2008 to 3/30/2009 and the data is sampled every 10 minutes. The source is available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PEMS-SF.<br><br><br>
### 1.9 PeMSD-BAY
It contains 6 months of statistics on traffic speed, ranging from 1/1/2017 to 6/30/2017, including 325 sensors in the Bay area. The source is available at:
https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN.<br><br><br>

## 2 METR-LA
It records four months of statistics on traffic speed, ranging from 3/1/2012 to 6/30/2012, including 207 sensors on the highways of Los Angeles County. The source is available at: https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN.<br><br><br>

## 3 LOOP
It is collected from loop detectors deployed on four connected freeways (I-5, I-405, I-90 and SR520) in the Greater Seattle Area. It contains traffic state data from 323 sensor stations over the entirely of 2015 at 5-minute intervals. The source is available at: https://github.com/zhiyongc/Seattle-Loop-Data.<br><br><br>
