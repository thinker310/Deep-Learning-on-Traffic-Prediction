## 1.PeMS
### 1.1.source dataset
It is an abbreviation from the California Transportation Agency Performance Measurement System (PeMS), which is displayed on the map and collected in real-time by more than 39000 independent detectors. These sensors span the freeway system across all major metropolitan areas of the State of California. The source is available at: http://pems.dot.ca.gov/.<br>
### 1.2.sub-dataset versions
Based on this system, several sub-dataset versions (PeMSD3/4/7(M)/7/8/-SF/-BAY) have appeared and are widely used. The main difference is the range of time and space, as well as the number of sensors included in the data collection.
#### 1.2.1 PeMSD3
This dataset is a piece of data processed by Song et al. It includes 358 sensors and flow information from 9/1/2018 to 11/30/2018. A processed version is available at: https://github.com/Davidham3/STSGCN.
#### 1.2.2 PeMSD4
It describes the San Francisco Bay Area, and contains 3848 sensors on 29 roads dated from 1/1/2018 until 2/28/2018, 59 days in total. A processed version is available at: https://github.com/Davidham3/ASTGCN/tree/master/data/PEMS04.
